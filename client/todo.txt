TODO
1. Google Analytics
  - Basic functionality complete.
  - Need to think through what 'events' we want to log for
2. On subscribe, a thank you email should be sent
  - Should be fully functional, but needs some style
3. Need a way for a user to unsubscribe
   - Mostly exists now at /unsubscribe
4. 404 page
   - Good enough, but style could improve
   - Something creative wouldn't hurt either
5. Automatically create relation between article and category when article is created
   - Maybe afterCreate middleware for article/post/whatever-i-called-it
6. Look at using script component to import css for article ([slug]) page
7. add functionality for adding tags to articles w/ strapi


BEFORE LIVE (or immediately after live)
