TODO
1. Google Analytics
  - Basic functionality complete.
  - Need to think through what 'events' we want to log for
2. On subscribe, a thank you email should be sent
  - Should be fully functional, but needs some style
3. Need a way for a user to unsubscribe
   - Mostly exists now at /unsubscribe
4. 404 page
   - Pretty good, but style could improve
   - Something creative wouldn't hurt either
6. Automatically create relation between article and category when article is created
   - Maybe afterCreate middleware for article/post/whatever-i-called-it
7. See if Avenir is available as a system font for mac/linux AND windows
   - Update body font if so
