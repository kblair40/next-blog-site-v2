1. Google Analytics
  - Basic functionality complete.
  - Possibly add more 'events' we want logging for

   - Good enough, but style could improve
   - Something creative wouldn't hurt either
3. Automatically create relation between article and category when article is created
   - Maybe afterCreate middleware for article/post/whatever-i-called-it
